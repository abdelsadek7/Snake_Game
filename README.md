# Snake_Game
Simple Snake Game (HTML/CSS/JS)

A lightweight Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is simple: control your snake, eat the squares (food), and grow longer.

How It Works

You control the snake using your keyboard.

When the snake eats a food square, it grows in length.

If the snake hits a wall or crashes into its own body, the game ends.

Everything runs in the browser with no libraries required.
